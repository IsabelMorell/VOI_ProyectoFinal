# VOI_ProyectoFinal: Mini game of ping-pong
## Project developed by Isabel V. Morell and Sof√≠a Negueruela

### Introduction
This project involves the use of a Raspberry Pi and the picamera module to design a security system which, once it is unlocked, will enable two players to compete in a ping-pong game where the Raspberry Pi will keep track of the points. To achieve this, we have divided the project in three parts. First, we have calibrated the camera using a chessboard. Then, we have implemented a security system where the password is formed by at least four colors and, lastly, we have developed a tracker that will detect the ping-pong ball's bounces and add the corresponding scores to the players.
