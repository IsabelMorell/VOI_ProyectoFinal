# VOI_ProyectoFinal: Mini game of ping-pong
## Project developed by Isabel V. Morell and Sof√≠a Negueruela

### Introduction
This project involves the use of a Raspberry Pi and the picamera module to design a security system which, once it is unlocked, will enable two players to compete in a ping-pong game where the Raspberry Pi will keep track of the points. To achieve this, we have divided the project in three parts. First, we have calibrated the camera using a chessboard. Then, we have implemented a security system where the password is formed by at least four colors and, lastly, we have developed a tracker that will detect the ping-pong ball's bounces and add the corresponding scores to the players.

### Methodology
#### Camera Calibration

#### Security System

#### Ping-pong game tracker
Once the correct password has been detected, the minigame starts. The program starts by calculating the fields thanks to a color segmentation and the Canny edge detector algorithm. The fields are shown in the following image:

After this, the program will keep track of the points scored by the different players using a color-based detection on the ball as well as a Gaussian Mixtures model. The bounces of the ball are detected by detecting the changes in direction of the ball and are then use to calculate de scoring.
The scoring is shown throughout the game in the video until a player wins. In this case, a message stating the winner and the final scoring will be shown.

### Results and next steps
The two output videos can be seen at the folder output. The one associated to the demostration named demo.mp4 is the video called output_tiempo_real_2jugadores.avi. 
As it is shown in the videos, the security system works correctly and efficiently in real team; however, the tracker has some problems detecting some points and giving them to the correct player.

To add to the project, the tracker could be perfected to work in real time and we could add some visual an audio effects like confetti when a point is scored. 
It would also add to the project to mix the different color rectangles of the security system with more figures.
